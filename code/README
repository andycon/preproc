# Tutorial 1: Preprocessing

    The scripts provided in this repository were written to accompany Professor
    Jim Haxby's Computational Methods graduate class, Dartmouth College,
    Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Winter 2021. This first
    installation is for preprocessing the data needed to complete Assigment 1.
    The dataset for the assigment is from: 

    Nastase Samuel A., Halchenko Yaroslav O., Connolly Andrew C., Gobbini
    M. Ida, Haxby James V. Neural Responses to Naturalistic Clips of Behaving
    Animals in Two Different Task Contexts. Frontiers in Neuroscience (12) 2018.

## Step 0: Get the data with Datalad

    Before doing anything, get the data. Install Datalad, if its not install
    already. Then open a terminal (Linux, Mac, or any nux), and type:

    datalad get https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000233

    This will create an empty "skeleton" of the dataset, including all of the
    files except none of the data. See the Datalad handbook to learn more.

## Step 1: Checkout this repository using Git

    Go into the directory for the dataset and navigate to the derivative folder:

    cd ds000233/derivatives

    Because you are now in a Datalad repository, you are also in a Git
    repository, and you are about to add stuff, so to keep things neat, you can
    tell git (with respect to the dataset ds000233) to ignore everything you are
    about to do by typing:

        echo "preproc/" > .gitignore
        git add .
        git commit -m"Ignoreing everything in preproc"

    Now clone this repository. (Note that if you are reading this you have
    already done this, and well, maybe it's already in the right place. In that
    case go on to step 2.) The code "as is" is made to run from the preproc
    folder in the derivatives subdirectory of ds000233. If you want to run it
    from somewhere else, feel free, except that you will have to update all of
    your path definitions.  Colne the repository using:

        git clone https:/github.com/andycon/preproc.git

    To ensure that you don't track any preprocessed data with git type:

    Then cd into the preproc directory:

        cd preproc

    To ensure that you don't track any preprocessing data with Git type:
        echo "sub-*" > .gitignore
        

## Step 3: Run the preprocessing 

    First read through the file preproc_funcs.sh. This is a Bash script that
    will preprocess one subject at a time using AFNI. (Note: you will need a
    working installation of AFNI before you begin.) You can preprocess a single
    subject by running the script by typing:

    Option 1. 
        bash preproc_funcs.sh 01

        or just:

        ./preproc_funcs.sh 01

        Either of these will preprocess all functional data for subject '01'. Be
        sure to see the information about the "cleanup_preproc.sh" option. Using
        this will remove all intermediate files at the end of the preprocessing
        script and will save valuable space on your hard drive.

    Option 2.
        bash preproc_all.sh

        This script can take care of preprocessing all of the subjects. See the
        information in the preproc_all.sh file for more on how to do this, and
        for more options. 

        Optional Note: Running all of your subjects in a row with one process
        can take a long time. If you choose to try this on Discovery, you may
        find that your ssh connection times out. To avoid this, you can use the
        program "screen" to disconnect from an open shell session, so that your
        process will keep running even after you disconnect from Discovery. 

        Type:
            screen -S preproc_all

            this will open a new virtual terminal. You may need to reload any
            modules:

            i.e., 
                module load python/3-Anaconda
                module load afni/2020_12_07

            Once you've started your long-running set of processes, you can
            disconnect from your virtual screen by typing:

                <CTL>-A D

            You can see the name of your disconnected screen by typing:

                screen -list

            And reconnect by typing:
                
                screen -r preproc_all<screenID>

## Step 4: Run the Alignment script.

    Once you have successfully preprocessed all the functional data, use the
    align_all.sh to align all subjects to a common MNI space. See the script
    align_to_MNI.sh, and align_all.sh for details.

## Step 5: Start the MVPC section

    You can start the Multivariate Pattern Classification portion of the
    tutorial once all of the data is preprocessed and aligned. Use AFNI, or
    another fMRI visualization tool to inspect your data and make sure everythin
    is ok.

    If everything is ok, move back to the derivatives folder:

    cd ../../

    and clone the mvpc repository:

    git clone https://github.com/andycon/mvpc.git
    
    Then go into the code directory and type:
        cd mvpc
        echo "sub_*" > .gitignore # similar to before, don't git track datafiles
        echo "group*" >> .gitignore # note the >> as opposed to >
        cd code
        less README 

    for more instructions.
