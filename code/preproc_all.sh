#################################### Bash 101 ##################################
#
#   FOR loop for iterating across subjects and processing each subject in turn
#   by calling :
#       bash preproc_funcs.sh <SUB>
#
#   The array of subjects is written as a string assigned to the variable subs
#   with spaces (or any white space) separating the subject ids. The FOR-loop
#   uses the white spaces to parse the string and assigns the values
#   one-at-a-time to the variable $s for doing the DO section.   
#
#########################  SEND OUTPUT TO LOG FILE  ###########################
#
#   If you want to make a record of the output add the following after the <SUB>
#   argument on the same line:
#       > $s.preproc.log 2>&1
#   
#   The greater-than symbol > redirects standard output stdout to a file (or bit
#   stream) here named $s.preproc.log.  The $s is the aforementioned subject
#   variable, so if $s was 01 the file name resolves to 01.preproc.log, and
#   because there is no path preceding the output file, it will be written to
#   the present working directory <pwd>. 
#   
#   The next part:
#       2>$1
#   
#   takes standard error stderr output 2, i.e. the second output from the
#   code execution, and redirects it >& to stdout 1 which was the first output.
#   So 2 gets redirected to 1 which gets redirected to the log file. The end
#   result is that you don't see anything written to the screen when you execute
#   the script. All messages and error messages get written to the log, which
#   can be useful later for checking errors.
#
#################### FOR THE INTREPID WITH LOTS OF DISK SPACE ################## 
#
#   If you are impatient and cavalier, you can use a for loop in Bash to try to
#   process all of the subjects at once by adding a final ampersand at the end
#   of the call: 
#       & 
#   Thus the whole thing might be:
#       bash preproc_funcs.sh <SUB> > $s.preproc.log 2>&1 &
#
#   This makes it so that Bash does not wait until the last command returns to
#   execute the next command. So this will submit all of the subjects at once,
#   and runs them in the background in parallel. It might be possible to use up
#   all of your RAM and overwhelm your processors so that your computer slows or
#   even freezes! Monitor your resources while testing code like this. I like
#   the linux utility htop - open another terminal on the same machine and type
#   htop, if that doesn't work, type top, and then install htop. htop lets you
#   watch your RAM and processors, and lets you manage open processes. My
#   computer has 16Gb RAM and 12 processing cores, which is more than enough. If
#   you have less than 8Gb RAM try submitting two or three subjects at a time,
#   at first.
#
#   NOTE WELL: Because the cleanup script is only executed after the
#   preprocessing steps are complete, then trying to run all of the subjects at
#   once will temporarily use up hard drive space to the tune of about 150 Gb.
#   If you have Gigabytes to spare, then spins the wheel and takes yer chances!
#   On Discovery, the default home directory quota is just 50 Gb, so you woold
#   need to write to a location like /scratch, or something with a high quota.
